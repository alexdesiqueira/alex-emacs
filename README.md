# Alex's Emacs

After using Emacs on and offish for ~ 20 years (combined
time would probably be less than a few months!), it's time
to learn and adopt it "properly," for good.

This is my setup. It's supposed to be minimal; I've tried
Doom, Spacemacs, Prelude, and while they're great, I want to
learn how to do things in mostly Emacs itself. I don't see a
reason to add an alternative package that "improves Emacs"
if I don't know how the vanilla setup works.
